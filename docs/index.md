Empowering Cannabis Cultivation in Controlled Environments

OpenTrecken is an software stack designed to automate the way cannabis is grown in controlled environments. With a focus on simplicity, scalability, and data-driven cultivation, our open-source project enables growers of all sizes to optimize their yields and enhance the quality of their crops.

## Features:

Sensor Integration: OpenTrecken seamlessly integrates with a wide range of sensors, including temperature, humidity, air pressure, CO2 levels, and water quality metrics like EC and pH. This comprehensive monitoring system ensures growers have real-time insights into the vital parameters affecting plant health and growth.

Distributed System: Our project is built on a distributed architecture, leveraging ESP microcontrollers running Tasmota firmware and Raspberry Pi computers. This allows for efficient data collection, processing, and control across multiple grow rooms, from small home setups to large-scale cannabis social clubs.

Data Analytics and Visualization: OpenTrecken harnesses the power of Prometheus for reliable data storage, Node-RED for automation and control, and MongoDB for flexible data management. The integration with Grafana offers intuitive and customizable dashboards, enabling growers to analyze trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions to optimize their cultivation processes.

Remote Monitoring and Management: Stay connected with your grow rooms from anywhere in the world. OpenTrecken facilitates secure remote access through VPNs built with Tailscale or Wireguard. Monitor environmental conditions, adjust settings, and receive real-time alerts, ensuring your plants are thriving even when you're away.

Open-Source and Collaborative: OpenTrecken is an open-source project, inviting growers, developers, and enthusiasts to contribute, improve, and expand its functionalities. Benefit from a vibrant community, share knowledge, and explore new possibilities together.
